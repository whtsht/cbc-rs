# xten0: Low-level `x86_64` library to assist with JIT/AOT compilation for Rust

xten0 provides the following features for JIT/AOT compiler implementation:

* The `asm` module provides an `x86_64` assembler that runs on Rust's `io::Write`. It supports writing data and rodata, defining symbols and embedding relocation information.
* The `elf` module provides the ability to generate relocatable objects in ELF format. You can convert an `Object` (generated by the `asm` module) into an ELF binary and link it with a common linker.
* The `jit` module provides the ability to load `Object` into memory and prepare it for direct execution.
